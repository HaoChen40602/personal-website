                <p>
                    My name is Hao Chen. I am currently a sophomore. I am interested in computer science. I like playing soccer and badminton with friends in my free time and love listening to music and I especially value the lyrics of songs. I am an optimistic person and can always cheer people around me up. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    there are some projects I made in the past in the "My Projects" section. I hope you can find them useful! The "USACO Trainin Problem Analyis" section has some analysis on problems in the USACO Training Gateway. If you would like to learn more about algorithms or participate in the USACO competition, USACO Training problems can be really helpful! MAY THE HOLY COW OF BESSIE BLESS YOU!
