            You can greedily determine the earliest time the kth job can be finished by an "A" machine. For each machine, keep track when it
            will complete its current job. The time for it to complete the next job is this time plus the time is takes the machine to process
            a job. To determine the time for the kth job, pick the machine which would finish it first and assign that job to it, updating the
            time that the machine will complete its job.
        </p> 
        
        <p>
            Similarly, determine how early the kth job from the end can be put into a B machine, where earliness is measured from the end of
            all jobs. This is akin to flipping the process around, where each finish job must be `undone' by a B machine.
        </p>

            Once these two calculations have been done and the arrays have been sorted, you end up with a picture like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            Each line represents the activity of one job. Green and blue are "A" machines, and yellow, cyan, and purple are type "B" machines.
            A red line means that the job is in a container instead of a machine. The left portion corresponds to "A" jobs, where the end of 
            each line is the time at which the kth job is completed. The right portion corresponds to "B" jobs, where the beginning of the line
            is the earliest that the kth job can be started with respect to the ending time of the all the "B" jobs. The white space in the middle
            represents the `slack' time, the time that the job sits in an intermediate container
        </p>
        <p>
            The best option is to match up the earliest completed "A" job with the "B" job that starts earliest, the second earliest completed "A" 
            job with the second earliest started "B" job, etc. Take the maximum of these times. This corresponds to moving the two representations 
            together until they touch (one job has no 'slack' time).
