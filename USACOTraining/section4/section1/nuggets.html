            Farmer Brown's cows are up in arms, having heard that McDonalds is considering the introduction of a new product: 
            Beef McNuggets. The cows are trying to find any possible way to put such a product in a negative light.
        </p> 
        <p>
            One strategy the cows are pursuing is that of `inferior packaging'. ``Look,'' say the cows, ``if you have Beef McNuggets in 
            boxes of 3, 6, and 10, you can not satisfy a customer who wants 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 14, or 17 McNuggets. Bad packaging: 
            bad product.''
        </p>
        <p>
            Help the cows. Given N (the number of packaging options, 1 <= N <= 10), and a set of N positive integers (1 <= i <= 256) 
            that represent the number of nuggets in the various packages, output the largest number of nuggets that can not be purchased 
            by buying nuggets in the given sizes. Print 0 if all possible purchases can be made or if there is no bound to the largest number.
        </p>
        <p>
            The largest impossible number (if it exists) will be no larger than 2,000,000,000.
