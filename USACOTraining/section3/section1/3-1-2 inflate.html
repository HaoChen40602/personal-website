           It is easy to see that this is a infinite knapsack problem. if you know how to solve knapsack problems without duplication, then all you will need to do is to change the <br>
           dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp<mark>[i - 1]</mark>[j - things[i].weight] + things[i].value); <br>
           to <br>
            dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp<mark>[i]</mark>[j - things[i].weight] + things[i].value);<br>
            This is because that given a infinite number of this object, you can derive current case from a case that might already choose this object once.
