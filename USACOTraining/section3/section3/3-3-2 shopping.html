            There are two ways of doing this problem. I did it in DP. 
        </p>
        <p>
            you need to assign a new ID for each product, since there are at most 5 products, we can just open a 5D array. dp[A][B][C][D][E] means the minimum money we have to spend to buy A number of item 1, B number of item 2, C number of item 3, D number of item 4, E number of item 5.
        </p>
        <p>
            when you think about it, you can realize that the current situation can be derived from (num_offer solution + 1) situations: you either buy it one by one, or you use a offer and spend offer.cost + dp[a][b][c][d][e], the situation after using the offer. get the minimum of all that. the DP formula is
            
        </p>
        <p>
            sol[a][b][c][d][e]= min (a*price[1] + b*price[2] + c * price[3] + d * price[4] + e * price[5],
            so[k].price + sol[a-so[k].prod[1].items] [b - so[k].prod[2].items] [c-so[k].prod[3].items] [d-so[k].prod[4].items] [e-so[k].prod[5].items]);
        </p>
