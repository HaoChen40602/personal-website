            this is a DP problem with game theory. We use dynamic programming to determine, for every possible piece of board that could be left at any point in the game, how many points the best strategy gets for the winner, and how many for the loser.

            let's define dp[i][j] to be the maximum score the player that is currently playing can get in the interval starting at i and ending at j. the equation is<br>
            dp[start][end] = max(min(dp[start + 2][end], dp[start + 1][end - 1]) + board[start], min(dp[start + 1][end - 1], dp[start][end - 2]) + board[end]);
