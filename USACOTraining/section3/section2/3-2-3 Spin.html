            The key observation for this problem is that after 360 seconds, the wheels have returned to their original locations, so if the wheels don't line up in 360 seconds, they will never line up.

            To determine if there is a location through which a light can be shine, mark, for each wheel, which angles between 0 and 359 a light can be shone through. If any location gets marked for all the wheels, then a light can be shone through the entire system. Otherwise, no light can be shone through all the wheels.
