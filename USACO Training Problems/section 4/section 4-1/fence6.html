            The first problem is to switch the problem into a graph. The easiest graph representation to use is an adjacency list, where each 
            node has the list of edges that are incident to it. The problem specifies that the endpoint of each edge will coincide with no more 
            than 8 other endpoints.
        </p> 
        <p>
            For simplicity, let the endpoints of fence segments be the nodes of the graph, and the edges be of two types: the ones across 
            fence segments and the ones connecting points which are at the same location (another alternative is to just have one node for
            each location).
        </p>

            Given the input, it's fairly simple to determine which side of fence A that fence B is connected to by determining which 
            adjaency list of fence B contains A.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the graph representation is done, the problem is to find the shortest cycle (edges between nodes at the same location 
            are considered to have length zero). For each edge, find the minimum length simple cycle which contains it by deleting that edge 
            and finding the minimum length path from one end of the edge to the other. We can just use Dijkstra's to determine the shortest path.
