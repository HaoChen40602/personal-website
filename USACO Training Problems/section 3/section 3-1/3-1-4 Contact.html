           For this problem, we keep track of every bit sequence we see. We could use the bit sequence itself as an index into a table of frequencies, but that would not distinguish between the 2-bit sequence "10" and the 4-bit sequence "0010". To solve this, we always add a 1 to the beginning of the number, so "10" becomes "110" and "0010" becomes "10010".
        </p>
        <p>
            After reading the entire bit string, we sort the frequency table and walk through it to print out the top sequences.
