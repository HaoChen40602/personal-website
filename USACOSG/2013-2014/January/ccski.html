           We can solve this probelm using Binary search and BFS. we can use Binary search for this problem because if a value for D works, then any value greater than that also works. if a value does not work, then any value less than that also does not work.

            then, we can write the varify function using the BFS. we simply BFS from a waypoint, and see if we are able to visit all other waypoints. if we can, that means this D value works.
