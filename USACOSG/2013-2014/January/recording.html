           This problem does have a DP approach, but we can also solve this probelm greedily, and the greedy approach acctually has a better performance in both space and time complexity, in addition, it is also a lot easier to code.

            So I choose to use the greedy approach. Note that we always try to fit a program into the two tuners whenever we can. also, given the current situation, if we are able to add a program to our track, we want it to end as early as possible so that it will hinder the recording of other program later. thus, we can sort the programs according to the end time and add the current program to our tuner whenever we can. if a program can be put into both tuners, then the program should be greedily scheduled on the track with the later ending current program.
