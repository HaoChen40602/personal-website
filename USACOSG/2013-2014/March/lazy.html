        <p>
            if we solve this problem using brute force(try all starting points, and try all points to see if bessie can reach there), the time complexity will be O(n^4), which is a bit too slow for this probelm. However, we are able to use prefix sum to speed up out program. since for a row, the grids that bessie can visit are always consecutive, we can thus still try all possible points, and calculate the amount of grass she can eat starting at this position in O(N) time, which leads to a total time complexity if O(n^3).
