            This problem is relatively easy. we can sort the words while keeping track of the original index. A key observation here is that words with the same prefix always stays together in the sorted array. then, we can Binary search that find the smallest word greater than the prefix, which is the start of the block of words with this prefix. then, we count to the Kth element, and see if it is a word with the prefix. if it is, then we output its original index, if it is not, then we output -1;
