           We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. first, let us only consider jumping from left to right. dp[i][j] means the maximum score we can get if we start at target i and jump to target j in our first jump. the transition equation will simply be max(value[i] + dp[j][k]), where (k - j >= i - j).
        </p>
        <p>
            we can also keep a running maximum keeping track of the maximum of dp[]
