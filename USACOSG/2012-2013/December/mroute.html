           this problem can be solved using dijkstra's algorithm. All we need to do is to modify the weight of an edge. The weight of an edge is actually (latency + X / capacity). Another worth mentioning is the that when you add an edge, the new latency is (edgeAdded.latency + current.latency) and new capacity is min(edgeAdded.capacity, current.capacity).
