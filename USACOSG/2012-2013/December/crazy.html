           this is a computational geometry problem. The code for computation geometry problems  are always <strong>extremely</strong> long because you need to copy and past a lot of templates into your code. here are some basic techniques. <br><a href="Sedgewick-elementarygeometricmethods.pdf" target="_blank">basics</a>

            after copying all the code needed for the isIn function which tells us whether a point is inside a polygon, we can floodfill to seperate those fences given into polygons. then for ever cow,we figure out the set of polygons it is in. then, if any cow have the exactly same set of polygons they are in, they are in the same community.
