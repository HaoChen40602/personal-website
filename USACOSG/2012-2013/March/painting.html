            We can solve this problem using sweep line. we store the two vertical edged of each rectangle in an array and sort them. then, we can loop through the array and, whenever we encounter a left edge, we add it into the list of current enclosures that are not contains within other enclosures if the edge does not lay inside another edge(for edample, an edge with height from 1-2 is inside an edge with height from 0-3) in the arraylist.
        </p>
        <p>
            if the edge is an right edge, we then remove its corresponding left edge from the list.
