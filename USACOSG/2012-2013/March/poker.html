            We can think solve this problem by thinking about how many straights will start with a specific card. in order to play all "ones", we need numberOfOne straights to start with card One. then, for every card after that, if the number of this type of card if less than the number of the previous card, then we don't need any straights to start at this position because we can always used up this type of card in straights starting with cards before it. if the number of this type of car is greater than the number of the previous card, then we will need (num[i] - num[i - 1]) straights to start at this position because there are no other ways to play them.
        </p>
        <p>
            so the answer will be the sum of straights starting at each position.
