            if there are no holes inside, then we can simply run a BFS on the haybales to get the perimeter. but since there are holes in the middle, it is hard for us to determin if a hybale if touching outside region or merely a hole. 
        </p>
        <p>
            we can use another approach to solve this problem. if we can't ran a BFS on haybales, why don't we run one on the outside regions? that solve the problem of not being able to distinguish between holes and outer regions.

            One thing here:<br>
            ###*###<br>
            ##***##<br>
            #*****#<br>
            *******<br>
            #*****#<br>
            ##***##<br>
            ###*###<br>
            we don't want the above rectangle because from (0, 0) you can only visit one fourth of the outer region. instead we want the one below:<br>
            #########<br>
            ####*####<br>
            ###***###<br>
            ##*****##<br>
            #*******#<br>
            ##*****##<br>
            ###***###<br>
            ####*####<br>
            #########<br>
