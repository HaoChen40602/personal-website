            This problem can be solve using topological sort. But in this case we don't atually have to. instead, we can keep track of how many prerequisites of a cow has not yet been milked in an array D. when we milk a cow, we delete it from prerequisites from other cows. we add a cows in to the priority queue whenever all of its prerequites are all milked.
