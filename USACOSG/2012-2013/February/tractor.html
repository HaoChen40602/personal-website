            This problem can be solve using binary search and BFS. BInary search works because if a specific answer works, then any answer greater than it also works. if an answer does not work, then anything less than it will not work either. 
        </p>
        <p>
            to see if a value works or not, we loop through every node and whenever we see a node that is not yet visited, we run a BFS on it and mark all the points it connects to as visited. later we can check if the largest block has an area larger than half of the total area.
