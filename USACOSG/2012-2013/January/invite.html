            this problem is relatively easy. we open an arraylist of HashSets and create a hashset for each of the groups. then, we open a queue into which we add cows that we are going to invite. first, we add cow 1 to the queue. for every cow in the queue, we loop through all hashsets and remove it if it is present. if the length of a hashset becomes one after deleting the cow, we can delete the hashset and add that one cow into out queue. we repeate this process until the queue is empty.
        </p>
        <p>
            one little here is that if you want to delete items from an arraylist, you will have to loop through it from the end to the start.
