           The hardest part of this problem is to build the graph. If we have out graphs built, we can simply run a shortest path algorithm on the graph and see the shortest distance from the start to the end. Now, we notice there are two things that matters: the location and whether you smells like orange. Thus, we can create 2 * N * M nodes and connect them according to the rules of the dream. Note that since all the pathes have a weight of one, we can actually run bfs instead of dijkstra's algorithm. But if you want to do that,
