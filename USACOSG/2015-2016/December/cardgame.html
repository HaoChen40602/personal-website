           It's always best to use your N/2 highest cards in the first half, and your N/2 lowest cards in the second half. This means we can consider both halves completely independently, since we know which cards are going to be played in each.

            (For the remainder of the analysis, we'll only consider the first half -- the second half can be analyzed with very similar arguments.)
        </p>
        <p>
            in each half, you always start from the card that are the easiest to beat and use the card that is weakest card you have to beat it.
