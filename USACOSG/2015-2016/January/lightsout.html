            This problem asks us to simulate Bessie tracing the barn clockwise until she knows where she is. One way to think about this is to abstract away the polygon aspect of the problem and instead treat the angles and side lengths as a string. Now we need to help Bessie explore a string instead. Therefore we want try, for each starting position, extending the string until we get a unique substring.</p>
        <p>
            It's efficient enough to simply use a set structure to test for uniqueness of a substring. To make it faster one could use hashes or suffix arrays instead.        </p>
