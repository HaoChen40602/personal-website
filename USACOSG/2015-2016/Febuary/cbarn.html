           Intuitively, we want to start from a position, then put every cow we met into a queue and fill the spot with the first cow in the queue. In this way we can minimize the total energy consumed. However, the problem is where should we start. Note that we always want to have enough cow to fill in every spot we met and therefore we should start at the position where when you start walking, we always have enough cows. we can do this by keeping a wait array and keep track of how many cows are waiting at this spot or how many cows do we lack at this spot if we start at 0. then, we should start at the room right after the room where waiting is the minimum.
