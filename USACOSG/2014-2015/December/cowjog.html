        <p>
           We can make an array of ending positions if they can pass each other in the starting order. we knew that the array should be non-decreasing. thus, we can get the number of groups by iterating from the end to the start and keep the minimum we encountered. whenver we met a cow that is smaller than the minimum, it is not in the same group as any cows to its right. thus, we add one to the number of groups.
