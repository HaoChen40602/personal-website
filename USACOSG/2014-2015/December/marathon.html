           This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. dp[i][j] means the minimum amount of distance we need to run when we are currently at checkpoint i and have j chances to skip a checkpoint left. 
        </p>
        <p>
            at the state dp[i][j], we are able to move to this situation from dp[i - a][j - 1 + a] + dist(point i, point i - a), where a is between 1 and K.
