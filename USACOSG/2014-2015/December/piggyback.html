           To solve this problem, we can run the shortest path algorithm on point 1, 2, and N. then, we try all points at which they might meet and use the strategy of piggyback. note that when the point is N, it is equal to the condition that they walk saperately.

            also, we don't need to use Dijkstra's algorithm for this problem since a BFS will work perfectly because every path costs the same.
