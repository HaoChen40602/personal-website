           We can solve this problem using sweep line, but this time we are sweeping over time.we saw the points in time that a cow enter FJ's sight and leave FJ's sight as two critical points. then, we sort them according to the time. whenever to encounter a starting point, we add it to treeset and mark the one with smallest y value to be visible, whenever we encounter a ending point, we remove it from the treeset and mark the one with smallest y value to be visible. Then, we simply output the size of the visible set.
