           the key observation for this problem is that we can devide a single one-way flight into many more sub-pathes. for a one-way flight, we can start at any point i and exit at any point that is after i, and the cost is always the same: cist for this flight. another thing is that to take the number of trips into account, we can keep track of another value in the edge objects and take that into account too when we are comparing them.

            then, we simply need to run a shortest path and we can get the answer.
