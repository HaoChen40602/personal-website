           Since for each match we will have to eliminate a team and there must be a winner at the end, we know that there are N - 1 matches in total. also, every team have to have at least one match with other teams. From this points, we can observe that the final tournament structure forms a tree. what we need to do it We can run a "maximum spanning tree" on this graph
        </p>
        <p>
            to do that, we simply add a negative sign before the weight of every edge and run the minimum spanning tree algorithm.
