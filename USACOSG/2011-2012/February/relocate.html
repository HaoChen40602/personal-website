            this problem is pretty easy. we can run Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm from every market and sotore the dist arrays. Then, since farmer john can visited the markets in any order, we can generate all permutations of our visiting order and try them all. thus, we iterate through every non-market nodes, try all visiting order(home -> A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> home) on that node and pick the minimum.
