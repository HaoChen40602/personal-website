           We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. First of all, a key observation is that since the umbrellas can overlap, a longer umbrella will always work better than a shorter one. thus, the cost of umbrella should be non-decreasing. if a shorter umbrella costs less than a longer one, we can change the cost of the shorter umbrella to the minimum of costs of every umbrella longer than it.

        <p>
            let dp[i] denotes the minimum amount of money we need to spent to shelter every cow in the range from cow 0 to number i inclusive. for dp[i], we can try to add an umbrella covering cow i to cow k, k is less than i, and pick the one yielding the least cost. thus, dp[i] = min(dp[k] + costOfLength(posOf(i) - posOf(k + 1)).
