           This problem is pretty interesting. The key observation for this problem is that every cow can move at most once. Now, if we want to know if cow A is positioned before cow B in the initial sequence, there are 4 cases. they either move in the same picture, or they move in different pictures, one of them moves, or none of them moves. We can find that no matter what, in at least three pictures, their relative position is the same as that in the initial arrangement.

           Now, things are pretty clear. we can write a sort algorithm, and write the compareTo function using the method described above. I wrote a quick sort function.
