            We can solve this problem using DP. let dp[i][j][0] denotes the minimum cost to visit i H cows and j G cows and ends at the last H cow we met. let dp[i][j][1] denotes the minimum cost to visit i H cows and j G cows and ends at the last G cow we met. dp[i+1][j][0] = min(dp[i+1][j][0], dp[i][j][k] + source.dist(holstein[i])) and dp[i][j+1][1] = Math.min(dp[i][j+1][1], dp[i][j][k] + source.dist(guernsey[j])).
