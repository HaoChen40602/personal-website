            This is a graph theory problem. each fence is a node and there is an edge between any pair of nodes that is on the same horizontal line or vertical line. Note that we don't need to add an edge between any single pair of them because a lot of the edges will be wasted. Instead we can only add edges between adjacent nodes. in the end, we run a dijkstras and add 1 to the answer whenver we change direction.
