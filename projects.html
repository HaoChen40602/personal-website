                <h2>A little game in java: Flapy Bird</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a little game in which you control a little bird by helping it fly in order not to crash into the pipes. Because of the gravity, you will drop. You will also die if you hit the top or bottom of the screen. The screen is not resizable. There are many levels you can choose from. they are easy, normal, hard, crazy and impossible. In easy mode, you get 1 points every time you pass a pipe. 2 points for normal, 3 points for hard, 4 points for crazy and 5 points for impossible. There are also double mode and if any of the players die, the game ends. There is a leading board in this game and below that, your current place is there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How to play this game:<br>
                    To play this game, all you need to do is to run the main method of the “LauncherReal” class, type you username and choose the mode you want. Then the game begins! player 1 make the bird flies up by pressing space and player 2 (if it is double) have to use W. the game ends when you hit the pipe. Thanks for playing! ENJOY THE GAME!
